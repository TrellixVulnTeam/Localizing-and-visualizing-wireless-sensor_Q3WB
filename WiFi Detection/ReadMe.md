Files contained in this folder are the grc file, which is the flowchart in the Gnu Radio, and the python files that were written to pick the specific signal that we want and also to find the intensity of that signal.
Even though this part wasn't the major part of our project, it did allow us to have a better understanding of how we couldn't directly use the time frame to find the time difference between the two signals. And we also noticed from this part that the decoding process introduced the unpredictable time delay to the signals.
