# Localizing-and-visualizing-wireless-sensors.

Objective Description

Nowadays Iot is developing in an incredibly fast pace, and tons of sensors are involved into this process, which provides us better experiences with Iot concepts. In order to allow users to access the sensors' measurements faster and easier, we are trying to generate a method that not only localizes the surrounding sensors accurately, but also displays those sensors on a smartphone's screen everytime they are captured by the camera of that smart phone.

Envisioned Approach

To start with our project, we have to first think about how to localize the unknown sensors within a moderate range. There are two approaches that we are potentially using. One method is using radio signal to localize the sensors. We are planning to use either bluetooth or zigbee, which has low energy consumption, but at the same time is capable of communicating with the smartphones. Another approach is to use visual learning to capture the small signal sent by the sensors via LED blinking or so. Both methods will give us an accurate location of each sensor. Then we will have an app developed on ios or android platform. It basically activates the camera, connects to the surrounding sensors and displays all the correspoding measurements on screen.
